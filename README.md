## Overview

- This application was built to consolidate Server APIs knowledge;

  - A weather dashboard that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS

- [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) was used to retrieve weather data for cities

## Acceptance Criteria

The app functionality:

- When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

- When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:

  - The city name
  - The date
  - An icon representation of weather conditions
  - The temperature
  - The humidity
  - The wind speed

- When a user views future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:

  - The date
  - An icon representation of weather conditions
  - The temperature
  - The humidity

- When a user clicks on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
